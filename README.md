Features not implemented due to time constraints

1) Implemented only a basic level of validation for form fields but in the production version, we need to provide customized validation conditions for each field
   For example, a card number must be in a certain format to be valid
   For example, the mobile number must be 10 in length (similar validation to other fields)
2) Generic error message is shown when the form field is empty which could be made better by showing customized error message depending on form fields
3) Only a basic level of CSS is implemented due to time constraints
4) UI responsive for mobile-specific devices is not implemented due to time constraints
