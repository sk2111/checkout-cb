Features not implemented due to time constraints

1) Implemented only a basic level of validation for form fields but in production version
   we need to provide customized validation conditions for each fields
   For example => card number must be in certain format to be valid
   For example => Mobile number must be 10 in length
   etc...
2) Generic error message is shown when form field is empty which can be made better by showing 
   customized error message depending on form fields
3) Only basic level of css is implemeted due to time constraints
